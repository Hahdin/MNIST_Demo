# [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) with the MNIST dataset on Goggle Colaboratory

This is a very small example of accessing and using the MNIST dataset of hand-drawn numerals (0-9) for use with Tensorflow.

Colaboratory is a free [Jupyter notebook](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwib8O2Qt-niAhVUwcQHHXYTAPEQFjAAegQIBxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjupyter.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw2CO9GvtNGTFyG73jZ1Pd1Y) environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.

With Colaboratory you can write and execute code, save and share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, all for free from your browser.

## MNIST_Example.py

This is the notebook file for the example, converted to raw Python. You can enter and run the code from you Colaboratory Jupyter Notebook. The examples runs through accessing the data, setting up a training and test set, creating the optimizer and training the model. We then test how it performs on the dataset and print the results.

# [MNIST Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning
